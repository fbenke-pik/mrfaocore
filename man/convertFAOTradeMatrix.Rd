\description{
Convert FAOSTAT detailed trade matrix.
FAOSTAT does not balance or harmonize the import/export side reporting.
Furthermore, in terms of trade value, exporters are "usuallY" reporting FOB,
while importers report CIF. Difference in value,
given identical qty, is thus the transport margin mixed with unharmonized reporting.
