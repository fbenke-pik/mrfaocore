\usage{
readFAOTradeMatrix(subtype)
}
\arguments{
\item{subtype}{subsets of the detailed trade matrix to read in. Very large csv needs to be read in chunks
separated by export/import quantities and values, as well as kcr, kli and kothers (not in kcr nor kli)
Options are all combinations of c("import_value", "import_qty", "export_value",
"export_quantity" X c("kcr", "kli", "kothers", "kforestry"))
import is import side reporting while export is export-sde reporting}
}
\value{
FAO data as MAgPIE object
}
\description{
Read in FAOSTAT detail trade matrix.
FAOSTAT does not balance or harmonize the import/export side reporting.
Furthermore, in terms of trade value, exporters are "usuallY" reporting FOB, while importers report CIF.
Difference in value, given identical qty,
is thus the transport margin and any unharmonized reporting combined.
